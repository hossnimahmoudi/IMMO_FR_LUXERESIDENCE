Introduction to Nvector
=======================

|nvector_img| |tests_img| |docs_img| |health_img| |coverage_img| |versions_img|

Nvector is a suite of tools written in Python to solve geographical position
calculations like:

* Calculate the surface distance between two geographical positions.

* Convert positions given in one reference frame into another reference frame.

* Find the destination point given start point, azimuth/bearing and distance.

* Find the mean position (center/midpoint) of several geographical positions.

* Find the intersection between two paths.

* Find the cross track distance between a path and a position.


Description
===========

In this library, we represent position with an "n-vector",  which
is the normal vector to the Earth model (the same reference ellipsoid that is
used for latitude and longitude). When using n-vector, all Earth-positions are
treated equally, and there is no need to worry about singularities or
discontinuities. An additional benefit with using n-vector is that many
position calculations can be solved with simple vector algebra
(e.g. dot product and cross product).

Converting between n-vector and latitude/longitude is unambiguous and easy
using the provided functions.

n_E is n-vector in the program code, while in documents we use nE. E denotes
an Earth-fixed coordinate frame, and it indicates that the three components of
n-vector are along the three axes of E. More details about the notation and
reference frames can be found here:

Official releases available at: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nvector.


Installation
============

If you have pip installed and are online, then simply type:

    $ pip install nvector

to get the lastest stable version. Using pip also has the advantage that all
requirements are automatically installed.

You can download nvector and all dependencies to a folder "pkg", by the following:

   $ pip install --download=pkg nvector

To install the downloaded nvector, just type:

   $ pip install --no-index --find-links=pkg nvector


Unit tests
===========
To test if the toolbox is working paste the following in an interactive
python session::

   import nvector as nv
   nv.test(coverage=True, doctests=True)

The `nvector package <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nvector/>`_ for
`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ was written by Per A. Brodtkorb at
`FFI (The Norwegian Defence Research Establishment) <http://www.ffi.no/en>`_
based on the `nvector toolbox <http://www.navlab.net/nvector/#download>`_ for
`Matlab <http://www.mathworks.com>`_ written by the navigation group at
